Juniper_Device is the top level API for all juniper devices.

The API is designed to automatically genetrate the nested classes and to perform an init of these classes based on different input.

For now text parsing "show configuration | disaplay set" format is suppoted.

In the future different "show configuration" flavours may be added as well.

Netconf initialization is planned and in some casses SNMP can init can be added.
